# Electric_Con_Badges
This is just an instruction set, files, and generally everything you need to make your own electronic convention badge that looks... ok and functions sometimes.

First off is the required items and software. You will need:
  One of the PCBs this project is based around
  A Adafruit ProTrinket 5V 16Mhz: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0131VM9I0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
  A color TFT screen: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CZL6QIQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
  Some THT 3 pin switches: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QAJUUS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
  And a battery charger board: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2124
    This charger board can be ordered along with a battery, I reccommend a 500mAh battery to get the most use out of this system
  
  You will also need a soldering iron and solder as well as basic soldering knowledge
    Having a helping hands can help quite a bit as well, but everything should be doable without one
  
  For software you will need the Arduino IDE asw well as any photo editing program that lets you resize and convert photos to bitmaps you     can literally just use MS Paint for this.
